In this folder are two different types of geometry:
- The .m meshes are geometries with a sharpe Edge in between the lowerWall in the Inlet section and the diffusor ramp
- The .v meshes are meshes with a rounded edge in between the lowerWall in the Inlet section and the diffusor ramp

- The first number stands for the refinment level.
- The second number stands for the radius (just for .v meshes). Bigger numbers are smaller radiuses.
